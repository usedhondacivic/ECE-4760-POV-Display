Project Introduction

*One sentence "sound bite" that describes your project.
A summary of what you did and why.*

High level design
* *Rationale and sources of your project idea*
* *background math*
* *logical structure*
* *hardware/software tradeoffs*
* *Discuss existing patents, copyrights, and trademarks which are relevant toyour project.*

Program/hardware design
* *program details. What parts were tricky to write?*
* *hardware details. Could someone else build this based on what you have written?*
* *Be sure to specifically reference any design or code you used from someone else.*
* *Things you tried which did not work*

Results of the design
* *Any and all test data, scope traces, waveforms, etc*
* *speed of execution (hesitation, filcker, interactiveness, concurrency)*
* *accuracy (numeric, music frequencies, video signal timing, etc)*
* *how you enforced safety in the design.*
* *usability by you and other people*

Conclusions
* *Analyse your design in terms of how the results met your expectations. What might you do differently next time?*
* *How did your design conform to the applicable standards?*
* *Intellectual property considerations.*
    * *Did you reuse code or someone else's design? Did you use any of Altera's IP?*
    * *Did you use code in the public domain?*
    * *Are you reverse-engineering a design? How did you deal with patent/trademark issues?*
    * *Did you have to sign non-disclosure to get a sample part?*
    * *Are there patent opportunites for your project?*
